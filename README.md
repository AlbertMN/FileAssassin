# FileAssassin
A simple program that deletes specific filetypes in specified folders on execution.

The project consists of two `.exe` files. One "Settings" executable where you specify which folders the `FileAssassin` executable should look in, and which file extensions to look for.

**Warning:** This software will delete anything it's told to delete. Use with caution and at own risk.

Originally designed to delete `.gcode` and `.stl` files in my "Downloads" folder on startup.
